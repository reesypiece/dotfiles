# dotfiles
hi. these are my laptop's dotfiles. it's a wip so far.

nowplaying's code taken from [spotify-now](https://github.com/micahco/spotify-now) and this [very simple shell script to get now playing from cmus](https://gist.github.com/KaliumPuceon/0615e3d6faf3a771c6aa323d0aed0ee2).

nvim config taken from [TorchedSammy's](https://github.com/TorchedSammy/dotfiles) and [nii-nvim](https://github.com/Theory-of-Everything/nii-nvim). make sure to follow lsp install instructions from nii-nvim in order for nvim to work

screenshots when i'm not lazy. all hail embark.

## TODO:
- [ ] refactor xmonad keybindings
- [ ] refactor nvim config
- [ ] create embark theme for gtk/firefox
